Contents
--------

With this version you should have obtained this README file
and an archive file containing the GAP interface and the data files,
in the following files and directories:

        data            the directory with the data files
        doc             the directory containing the list of changes
                        since the release of version 1.0 (with GAP 4.3),
                        in TeX format
        gap             the directory with the GAP code
        htm             the directory with the list of changes
                        since the release of version 1.0 (with GAP 4.3),
                        in HTML format
        init.g          the file that initializes the package
        read.g          the file that reads in the GAP 4 interface
        tst             the directory with some test files


Unpacking
---------

You may have got the GAP Tables of Marks Package as
a zoo archive (filename ends with .zoo)
or a compressed tar archive (filename ends with .tar.gz).
In each case, use the appropriate command on your system to unpack
the archive.

On UNIX systems the zoo archive may be unpacked by

    zoo x tomlib1r2p5.zoo

which will unpack the archive into a directory `tomlib' in the
current directory. 

On UNIX systems the compressed tar archive may be unpacked by

    tar xzf tomlib1r2p5.tar.gz

or, if tar on your system does not understand the option z, by

    gunzip tomlib1r2p5.tar.gz
    tar xf tomlib1r2p5.tar

which will in each case unpack the code into a directory `tomlib'
in the current directory.

If your system does not have a zoo programme, you can pick up the
C-code for unzoo from the GAP web page and compile it on your system.
For this your system needs to have a C-compiler.
unzoo can be used to unpack the zoo archive, as follows:

    unzoo -x tomlib1r2p5.zoo

unpacks the archive into a directory `tomlib' in the current directory.


Installation
------------

Installation of the GAP Tables of Marks Package means unpacking the
archive file in an appropriate directory.

For the two ways of installing GAP 4 packages in general,
see the sections "Installing a GAP Package" and
"GAP Root Directory" in the GAP 4 Reference Manual.

Once you have successfully installed the GAP Tables of Marks Package,
it is usually loaded automatically when GAP is started;
if not then it can be loaded explicitly by typing

gap> LoadPackage( "tomlib" );
true
gap>

at the GAP prompt.
Then the functions of the Package are available in the current session.
