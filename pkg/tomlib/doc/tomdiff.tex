This list contains the changes in the {\GAP} Library of Tables of Marks
since the release of TomLib~1.0 (together with {\GAP}~4.3) in May 2002.
We denote mathematical errors by {\bf ***} and new information
by {\bf NEW}\null.
We use {\bf C} to denote changes that are not obviously corrections;
the number of these changes is kept small.

valid straight line programs
